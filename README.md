The main goal is to discover product URLs across multiple e-commerce sites efficiently. Let's start by understanding how the existing code works and then think about optimizations based on the problem requirements.
First, the crawler uses asyncio and aiohttp for asynchronous HTTP requests, which is good for handling multiple domains concurrently. It also employs a retry mechanism with exponential backoff to handle transient errors. The code fetches HTML content, extracts links, and checks if they're product URLs using regex patterns. For dynamic content, there's a fallback to Selenium, which is smart because some sites load content via JavaScript.
The crawling is done in levels (BFS-like approach up to max_depth). Each level processes URLs asynchronously with a semaphore to limit concurrency. Visited URLs are tracked to avoid duplicates. Product URLs are collected and saved to a JSON file after each depth level.
